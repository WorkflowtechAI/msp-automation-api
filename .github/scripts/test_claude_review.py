"""Tests for the review-response parsing in claude_review.py.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The parsing it covers failed silently in production:
`content[0].get("text", "")` returns nothing when the first content block is a
`thinking` block, so PRs #23 and #24 posted "No review text returned" while the
API had already generated and billed ~2,048 output tokens of real review, and
both PRs went GREEN on that. The reviewer itself flagged the missing tests on
the fix's own PR. A parsing bug in the trust boundary of CI deserves recorded
response shapes, not a narrative.

Pure: no network, no API key, no subprocess. Run with `python -m unittest
discover .github/scripts` or `python .github/scripts/test_claude_review.py`.

    """THE ANSWER TO "EVERY FIX FOUND ITS NEIGHBOUR ONE ROUND LATER".

    Four leaks were fixed in this file in one week, and each was found only
    after the previous fix shipped: spaced concatenation missed the unspaced
    form, the prefixed VALUE missed the prefixed OPERAND, the tempered bare
    class missed the chain's call form, and the operator set missed the bare
    class that has to stop in front of it. Every one was the NEIGHBOUR of
    something already tested, missed because the pins were written from the
    example that motivated the change and inherited its incidental properties.
    Every pin in this file had spaces around the operator, because the shape
    that prompted them did.

    A generator does not have incidental properties. This walks the product of
    the axes the pattern actually branches on and asserts, for every one, that
    the sentinel does not survive.

    THE ORACLE IS ONE-SIDED, which is what makes this cheap and worth having.
    There is no need to know the correct output for 392,400 lines -- only that
    the secret is gone from each. Over-redaction is not tested here (the exact
    -output classes above do that); this asks the single question the file
    exists to answer.

    ZERO IS THE BASELINE, not a recorded count. Every combination these axes
    produce is covered, so a leak here is a regression rather than a known gap.
    Shapes that are still known to leak -- adjacency with no operator,
    subscript assignment, positional secrets, escaped quotes inside an
    enclosing string -- are deliberately NOT generated: they are recorded in
    HARNESS.md and #188, and generating them would mean pinning a nonzero
    baseline that hides a real regression inside an accepted one.

    # THESE USED TO READ AS `"<REDACTED>"` IN A REVIEWED DIFF. MOSTLY THEY NO
    # LONGER DO, AND THAT IS A FIX, NOT A REGRESSION.
    #
    # The history matters because it cost real review time. These fixtures are
    # vendor keys and the code under test detects vendor keys, so `redact()` ate
    # them on the way to the model. Two review rounds on #196 were shown
    # `"<REDACTED>"`, reasonably concluded the fixture was placeholder text, and
    # the second reported it as a BLOCKING bug. Both readings were correct about
    # what they had been shown, which is what made it expensive.
    #
    # SPLITTING THE LITERALS FIXED IT, as a side effect of fixing something else.
    # Written as `"ghp_" + "16C7..."` the SOURCE line carries no contiguous
    # vendor shape, so the redactor leaves it alone and the reviewer sees the
    # real fixture -- while the RUNTIME value is byte-identical, so the detectors
    # still fire and not one assertion moves. The split was forced by GitHub push
    # protection refusing the push (#209); this fell out of it. Measured against
    # main's redactor: all seventeen reach the model intact. (A first pass
    # measured eight lines and found seven; the six that push protection never
    # forced -- JWT, npm, HuggingFace, Replicate, PyPI, Docker Hub -- were still
    # contiguous and still eaten, and were split in the same commit.)
    #
    # ONE REDACTED ON ITS LABEL, NOT ITS VALUE. `redact()` fires on names
    # as well as values, so `"Stripe secret"` was eaten for the word `secret`
    # however the value was written. It is now `"Stripe live key"`. Nothing keys
    # on the label -- VENDOR_SAMPLES is only ever walked as
    # `for label, value in ...` -- so this changes no assertion, and it is the
    # rename that takes the class to seventeen of seventeen.
    #
    # WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE WRONG, and is the thing to check instead: a literal
    # `"<REDACTED>"` fixture would FAIL these tests, not pass them. That string
    # matches no vendor prefix, so it survives `redact()` unchanged, and the
    # assertion is `assertNotIn(value, redact(line))`. A placeholder cannot hide
    # here -- the suite going green is itself the proof the fixtures are real.
    #
    # If a fixture DOES still reach you redacted, that is the redactor working,
    # not a placeholder. Verify with
    # `git show <sha>:.github/scripts/test_claude_review.py` rather than by
    # asking for the value to be changed.
    #

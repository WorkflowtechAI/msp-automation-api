"""Generic Claude code-review for a pull request or full-codebase snapshot.

Dropped into a repo by operator-tools/Bootstrap-Repo.ps1 as
.github/scripts/claude_review.py and driven by .github/workflows/claude-review.yml.
Unlike the kit's own tuned reviewer, this one is project-agnostic: it names no
specific repo and uses language-neutral file patterns, so the same script works
in any bootstrapped repo. Set the REVIEW_PROJECT_NAME env var (the workflow does)
to give the reviewer the repo name; everything else has safe defaults.

# An env-var lookup NAMES a secret without containing one, the same category as
# the `${{ secrets.X }}` expression the pattern already leaves alone, and it is
# exempted for the same reason: redacting it rewrites working code into
# something that does not parse. `token = os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN") or ""`
# reached the model as `token=<REDACTED> or ""`, and the model reported a
# SyntaxError as a BLOCKING finding, twice in a row on kit #69, spending the
# whole review on an artifact. claude_review.py's own source hits this.
#
# NARROWED THREE WAYS, SO IT CANNOT HIDE A VALUE AND OVERTURNS NOTHING.
# (1) The call takes ONE string argument, so `os.environ.get("PW", "hunter2")`
# is not a lookup here and its default is still redacted. (2) The exemption is
# withdrawn if the rest of the line holds a non-empty quoted literal, so
# `... or "hunter2"` is still redacted while `... or ""` is left alone. (3) It
# does not apply where a type annotation was consumed, so
# `password: str = os.getenv("X")` still redacts type and default together.
# (4) The argument must look like an env var NAME -- an identifier, so
# `os.getenv("sk-ant-real-secret")` is not a lookup here and is redacted. An env
# var name is an identifier; a key generally is not, and matching on call shape
# alone would have let one through (caught in review on #74).
#
# The withdrawal in (2) reads ONE line, like every other branch in this table,
# so a fallback literal on a continuation line is not seen. That is the
# pre-existing limit of a line-oriented heuristic, not something this exemption
# widens: the same is true of every value shape here.
#
# `os.environ["X"]` is likewise left OUT: the subscript rule already redacts it
# and `token=<REDACTED>` reads as valid code, which is all this exemption is
# for. The shape that broke was the trailing ` or ""`, not the lookup itself.
#
# WHAT (1), (3) AND (4) NOW HAND ON. A lookup this exemption refuses is no
# longer hidden for being a call: `_hides_a_value` decides it like any other
# bare value. `os.environ["X"]` and `password: str = os.getenv("X")` come back
# as written, and so does the default in `os.environ.get("PW", "hunter2")`,
# which is a short literal argument; a default that is a token still goes.
# Every one of those is pinned by an exact-output test.
#
# THE JS NAME ENDS AT ITS LAST WORD CHARACTER (`(?!\w)`), so it cannot give
# letters back to find an end. `_NAMES_NOT_VALUES` refuses a word character
# after the lookup; without this, `\w*` backtracked one letter at a time, so
# `process.env.TOKEN]hunter2` matched as `process.env.TOKE` with `N` after it,
# and the fallback-literal scan below re-ran at every letter, quadratic in the
# length of the name.

# A PATTERN OR A PLACEHOLDER NAMES A SECRET WITHOUT CONTAINING ONE -- the same
# category as `${{ secrets.X }}` and the env lookup above, and the same failure
# mode: redacting it rewrites working code into something the model reports as
# broken, and the review is spent on the artifact instead of the diff.
#
# Measured on gestalt-workframe-edu#605, four consecutive rounds:
#
#     KEY_LINE = re.compile(r"^OPENROUTER_API_KEY=(.*)$", re.M)
#
# reached the reviewer as `^OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<REDACTED>` and came back as a
# BLOCKING finding -- "there is no capture group, .group(1) will raise" -- each
# time answered with the pushed blob and py_compile, each time re-reported. The
# f-string form `f"OPENROUTER_API_KEY={new_key}"` drew the same verdict: "this
# lambda ignores new_key and writes a fixed string to production".
#
# NARROWED SO IT CANNOT HIDE A VALUE.
# (1) A GROUP OR A REGEX LITERAL must open the value AND contain a REGEX IDIOM,
#     not merely a
#     character that regexes also use. `.`, `+`, `*` and `|` all appear inside
#     ordinary base64 -- `token=(AbC123+/==)` is a SECRET in brackets, and a
#     metacharacter test alone would have exempted it, turning a false positive
#     into a false negative, which is the worse direction. So the group must
#     contain `.*`, `.+`, a character class `[`, or a backslash escape --
#     and an opening `?` is NOT one of them. `(?:` looks like regex syntax and
#     is free to type around a literal, so `token=(?:hunter2)` would have been
#     exempt while holding a secret. A `(?...)` group qualifies only when it
#     also carries an alternation, which is what a grouped pattern is for:
#     `(?:a|b)` yes, `(?:hunter2)` no. `(.*)`, `([^"]*)` and `(\w+)` qualify;
#     `(hunter2)`, `(AbC123+/==)` and `(a|b|c)` do not.
#
#     `(a|b|c)` IS THE KNOWN OVER-REDACTION, and it is deliberate: a bare
#     alternation is also what a short secret in brackets looks like, and `|`
#     appears in no base64 alphabet but plenty of passwords. So a plain
#     capturing alternation still redacts -- the same false positive this change
#     set out to remove, kept where removing it would open a hole. Wrap it as
#     `(?:a|b|c)` and it is exempt, which is how a regex is usually written
#     anyway. A value with an identifier before
#     the paren is a CALL and is untouched here; the call rule redacts it whole.
# (2) A PLACEHOLDER is `{name}` with a LOWERCASE identifier -- the shape a format
#     string uses to say "the value goes here" (`{new_key}`, `{value}`). Keeping
#     it lowercase is what separates it from a token that happens to be braced:
#     `{SomeVaultToken123}` has capitals and stays redacted. `(?-i:...)` is
#     load-bearing -- the whole table compiles with re.I, so `[a-z_]` matched
#     `Hunter2` and the distinction did nothing until the flag was turned off
#     for this branch alone. A fully lowercase
#     alphanumeric secret wrapped in braces is the residual case, and it is
#     accepted knowingly -- this is a heuristic in front of a model, not a
#     boundary. `{"k": "v"}` has a quote and is not a placeholder, nor is `{a}{b}`.
# (3) EACH of them must END the value: a quote or whitespace follows it, or
#     `_VALUE_END` does (`_NAMES_NOT_VALUES` applies both), so
#     `api_key=(.*)hunter2` and `api_key=(.*)]hunter2` are not exempt.
# (4) A JAVASCRIPT REGEX LITERAL IS THE SAME CATEGORY ONE DELIMITER OVER, and
#     (1) reads the value's FIRST character, which for `/(?:a|b)/` is the slash
#     rather than the group. So the group branch never fired on one, and this
#     repo's own .claude/hooks/check-handoff-language.mjs:699
#
#         const DEPLOY_SCRIPT_TOKEN = /(?:^|[/\\])deploy\.(?:sh|ps1|py|mjs)$/i;
#
#     reached the model as `DEPLOY_SCRIPT_TOKEN="<REDACTED>")deploy\....$/i;`
#     -- the bare branch stopped at the first `)` INSIDE the group -- which is
#     invalid JS on a line that runs. Exactly the failure this comment block was
#     written about, in the file the reviewer reads most often, and it cost
#     three rounds on #179 for a different line.
#
#     IT OPENS NOTHING THE GROUP BRANCH HAD NOT. Same idiom bar, so `/hunter2/`
#     is a value in slashes and is redacted; and the literal must CLOSE -- a `/`
#     then JS flag letters then a value terminator -- so `/var/lib/secrets` is a
#     path, not a pattern, and goes too. A body that carries an idiom AND hides
#     a secret (`/hunter2[x]/`) is the residual `(a|b|c)` already has, inherited
#     rather than added.

# One regex-literal body character. `[` opens a CHARACTER CLASS and a `/` inside

#
# The name matches, so the rule fires; the right-hand side is the SAME variable
# with method calls on it. There is no literal to hide -- whatever the value is,
# it was already in the variable a line earlier -- and redacting it corrupts
# control logic in the text the model reads. On kit #200 the model then reported
# that corruption as a BLOCKING SyntaxError, accurately, on a file that compiles
# and whose suite was green in the same run. A correct reading of a wrong input
# is the worst failure this table has, because it is unanswerable without the
# blob.
#
# NARROWED SO IT CANNOT HIDE A VALUE.
# (1) The value must OPEN with the same identifier the key matched -- a
#     backreference, not a lookalike, so `token = token_source.strip()` and
#     `token = other.strip()` are ordinary values and still redact.
# (2) Only method calls and subscripts may follow, and the chain must END the
#     value. `token = token.strip() or "hunter2"` has a literal after the chain,
#     so it is not exempt and the literal still goes.
# (3) NO ARGUMENT OR SUBSCRIPT MAY CARRY A LONG ALPHANUMERIC RUN. `.strip("'\"")`
#     and `.split(",")` are punctuation and stay exempt; `.replace("hunter2abc", "")`
#     is a literal in an argument and is redacted. Eight characters is the bar,
#     the same order as the vendor entries below, and deliberately low: an
#     argument that long is doing something other than trimming.
#
#     The bracket branch did not have this guard for a while. Rule (3) was
#     written about arguments, the regex applied it to calls, and
#     `token = token["AbCdEfGh12345678"]` went through as a reshape with the
#     literal still on the line. Raised by the reviewer on
#     gestalt-workframe-edu#609 and measured before fixing: three of seven
#     shapes leaked, and the call branch beside them refused its control case.
#     Same lookahead, both branches, kit #212.
#
# `db_password = db_password.strip()` is NOT exempt, because the key group
# matches the tail (`password`) and the backreference then looks for `password`
# where the value says `db_password`. Over-redaction, and left alone: the safe
# direction, and narrowing it further would mean matching the whole name.
# Since capaz#107 that line comes back as written anyway: it holds no literal
# and no token, so `_hides_a_value` declines it.

# WHERE AN EXEMPT VALUE ENDS, for all five exemptions: the three names joined
# below, the expansion and the number. An exempt value ends where the bare value
# would end, or the text between the two ends reaches the model unredacted. The
# bare value stops at whitespace, a quote, `,`, `;`, `)` and a glued key, and
# reads through `]` and `}`. So an exempt value ends at:
#
# (1) a comment, `,`, `;`, `)` or the end of the line, after optional blanks.
#     An operator is not an end: the concatenation chain may be carrying a
#     literal, so `token = 4 + "hunter2"` redacts whole.
# (2) a closer after blanks (`{ token: 4 }`): the blank already ended the value,
#     and no chain starts at a closer.
# (3) a run of glued closers, when one of those or a quote follows the run.
#     `f({token: token.strip()}).then(x)`, `log(f"[token={token}]")` and
#     `'{"token": 4}'` stay as written. Text glued behind a closer is still the
#     value, so the line redacts whole:
#
#         token = token.strip()]wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG  ->  token="<REDACTED>"
#         token = process.env.TOKEN}hunter2Xk9mP2qR7   ->  token="<REDACTED>"
#         token = 4]wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG              ->  token="<REDACTED>"
#
#     All three reached the model whole on main. Kit #327 gave the number
#     alone a stricter end, and redacting there sent a glued second key to the
#     bare branch; that branch now stops in front of the key (`_BARE_CHAR`), so
#     declining an exempt value hands the key nothing. Since capaz#107 the
#     bare value is hidden only when it holds a literal or a token
#     (`_hides_a_value`), so the glued text above is a token in all three;
#     `}hunter2` alone comes back as written.
#
# A quote ends the value only after a closer. The self-reshape chain reads
# attribute names, so in `'token = token.hunter2'` a bare quote would end the
# exempt span with the name inside it, where main redacts the line.
#
# ONE DEFINITION FOR ALL FIVE, so they agree on where a value stops. Each leak
# above lived between two spellings of this end.

# the ` or ""` after it is the shape it exists for and its own lookahead

# (`os.getenv("X")hunter2`) is part of the value, so it redacts.
#
# A PATTERN OR PLACEHOLDER also ends at a quote or whitespace, since it usually
# sits inside a string (`f"KEY={new_key}"`, `r"^KEY=(.*)$"`).
#
# THE SELF-RESHAPE CHAIN ends at `_VALUE_END` alone, deliberately WITHOUT the

#     POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?set POSTGRES_PASSWORD in infra/compose/.env}
#     ->  POSTGRES_PASSWORD:"<REDACTED>" POSTGRES_PASSWORD in infra/compose/.env}

# and the reviewer reported the compose file as invalid YAML and a deploy
# blocker, on a line `docker compose config` accepts.
#
# NARROWED SO IT CANNOT HIDE A VALUE.
# (1) Only `${NAME:?message}` and `${NAME?message}`. The text after `?` is the
#     error the shell or compose prints when NAME is unset, never the value.
#     A default or alternate (`:-`, `-`, `:=`, `=`, `:+`, `+`) is consumed
#     WHOLE, through its closing brace, by the bare branch's own `${...}`
#     alternative, so `${PW:-correct horse}` no longer leaves `horse}` behind
#     as a fragment. Since capaz#107 it is hidden only when the default holds a
#     token (`_hides_a_value`); `correct horse` is two words and comes back.
#     In a config file (rule (0) above `_is_token`) it is hidden whatever
#     it holds.
# (2) A plain `${NAME}` and a bare `$NAME` are names. #56 pinned them as
#     redacted; since capaz#107 they come back as written outside a
#     config file, because a name holds no secret.
# (3) The expansion must BE the value and end it (`_VALUE_END`), quoted or
#     bare, after the enclosing string's closing quote in the compose list
#     form `- "PW=${PW:?msg}"`. `${PW:?msg}hunter2`, `${PW:?msg}]hunter2` and
#     `${PW:?msg} + "hunter2"` are values and redact whole.
#
# IT IS CONSUMED, NOT SKIPPED. A lookahead that declined the value would leave
# the scan to restart inside the braces, where `PASSWORD:?set` is a key and a
# separator of its own. The `ref` group takes the whole expansion and
# `_redact_assignment` hands the match back exactly as written. The same key
# INSIDE a longer value, a connection URL whose password is `${PW:?msg}`, is
# refused at the separator instead: SECRET_PATTERNS reads a `:?` that a `}`
# closes on the same line as an expansion operator, never as a separator.
#
# THE RESIDUALS, named in HARNESS.md: a secret typed as the MESSAGE reaches the
# model (the vendor-prefix half below still catches a keyed format), and so does
# a value glued to its colon that opens with `?` when a `}` follows later on the
# line (`{password:?hunter2}`). Without that brace, `password:?hunter2` redacts.
# The message is bounded at 200 characters, so a brace that never closes costs

# NARROWED SO IT CANNOT HIDE A VALUE.
# (1) The `token` name only, through the `tok` group. Every other name in the
#     key list keeps redacting a number, swept one by one: the `_key` family,
#     `secret`, `client_secret`, `password` and `passwd`. `password = 1234` is a
#     PIN, and a number under the rest can be a key id or a seed. Since
#     capaz#107 a short number under any name comes back as written outside
#     a config file, because `_hides_a_value` finds no token in it; this
#     exemption still decides the `token` case first, in a config file too.
# (2) A bare number only: a digit, then digits and `_`, then at most one decimal
#     point. A quote, a letter, a sign or an exponent makes it a value, so
#     `token = "123456"`, `token = 0x1F` and `token = 3e-6` redact as before.
#     ASCII digits only, spelled `[0-9]`: `\d` in a str pattern is any Unicode
#     digit, so `API_TOKEN = ` followed by fullwidth or Arabic-Indic digits
#     reached the model, and no source writes a count in those.
# (3) The number ENDS the value (`_VALUE_END`). The Telegram bot token shape,
#     `BOT_TOKEN = 123456789:AAH...`, opens with digits and runs on past the
#     colon, so it redacts whole, and `token = 4 + "hunter2"` still takes the
#     literal with it.
# (4) A type annotation in front is read through, so `CHARS_PER_TOKEN: int = 4`
#     stays whole as well; without it the no-annotation retry redacted the type
#     word and left `= 4` behind it.
#
# THE RESIDUAL: a credential made only of digits under a `token` name (a
# six-digit one-time code, a numeric PIN someone named a token) reaches the
# model. No vendor entry below is all digits, so the prefix half leaves it too.
# Pinned by test_the_residual_is_pinned_not_assumed and named in HARNESS.md.

# A STRING LITERAL'S PREFIX IS PART OF THE LITERAL, and the value branch read it
# as a bare value that happened to end where a quote began. So only the prefix
# was redacted and the literal went to the model intact:
#
#     password = f"Ab{x}AbCdEf0123456789ZzYyXx"
#     ->  password="<REDACTED>""Ab{x}AbCdEf0123456789ZzYyXx"
#
# Measured 2026-08-31, documented as a residual gap, and then raised twice in
# review on #182 as the one worth fixing rather than recording: f-strings are
# the ordinary way to build a string in the language most of this repo is
# written in, so "a secret in an f-string" is not an exotic shape here.
#
# `f`, `r`, `b`, `u` and their two-letter pairs (`rb`, `br`, `fr`), plus C#'s
# `$` and `@`. Spelled as a LENGTH rather than a letter list because the list is
# language-specific and grows, while the shape -- one or two letters welded to a
# quote -- does not.
#
# IT MUST ABUT THE QUOTE, no space, which is the whole safety argument. In prose
# a word before a quotation has a space after it, so `password: is "hunter2"`
# still reads `is` as the value and leaves the quote alone; only `is"hunter2"`
# would be taken, and that is not English. The prefix sits OUTSIDE the `qv`
# group on purpose: `_redact_assignment` reads `qv[0]` for the author's quote,
# and a prefix inside the group would make that quote the letter `f`.
_LITERAL_PREFIX = r"(?:[A-Za-z]{1,2}|[$@])"

# A CONCATENATED VALUE IS STILL ONE VALUE, and the value branch used to stop at
# the first closing quote. Measured on 2026-08-31, in the UNDER-redaction
# direction -- a leak, not a display cost, and the only one on this table:
#
#     const apiKey = "sk-ant-" + "AbCdEf0123456789ZzYyXx";
#     ->  const apiKey="<REDACTED>" + "AbCdEf0123456789ZzYyXx";
#
# The single-literal form of that line redacts correctly, so the whole gap was
# the `+`. It was named in neither this file nor HARNESS.md's list of residual
# gaps; the entry there now says what is still not covered.
#
# THE OPERATORS ARE THE ONES A LITERAL ARRIVES THROUGH, and each was measured on
# a line that leaked before it was added. Concatenation: `+` (JS, TS, Python,
# C#, PowerShell), `.` and `..` (PHP, Lua), `&` (VBScript, and *.vbs is reviewed
# here). Formatting: `%` (Python's old style). And FALLBACK: `||`, `??`, `or`,
# `and`.
#
# THE FALLBACKS ARE NOT CONCATENATION and are here anyway, because
# `const token = opts.token || "hunter2";` is the hardcoded-default-credential
# antipattern and one of the likelier ways a real key reaches a repo. The value
# is the whole expression, so redacting it whole is right rather than generous.
# They reach a literal or a call and never a bare name: `token = a || b` has no
# literal to hide, so consuming `b` would buy nothing and cost the reader the
# name. The word forms take `[ \t]+` on both sides so `password` and `passwordor`
# stay different names.
#
# `+` REACHES ANY OPERAND -- a literal, a call, a bare token. The others reach a
# literal or a CALL and not a bare token, because they are also attribute
# access, bitwise-and and an English full stop: `password: "hunter2". Then the
# user...` would otherwise take the sentence. Reaching the call is what makes
# `password = "Ab".concat("hunter2")` go whole; `token = "abc".strip()` goes
# with it, which is over-redaction on a line whose value was already gone.
#
# `[ \t]`, NEVER `\s`, on both sides of the operator. A `+` at the start of the
# next line is a DIFF MARKER, and a diff is mostly what this function sees; a
# chain that crossed the line break would join a redacted value to the next
# hunk line. Bounded at 64 links, and each link must consume its operator, so
# the repeat cannot spin. RedactionIsLinear pins the cost.
#
# A `${{ secrets.X }}` operand ENDS the chain, for the reason it is left alone
# everywhere else here: it names a secret without holding one, and consuming it
# rewrites a workflow into something the model reports as broken.
# THE PREFIX REACHES THE OPERANDS TOO, and for one round it did not. #182 put
# `_LITERAL_PREFIX` in front of the `qv` group, so a prefixed literal was
# recognised as THE VALUE -- and left `_CONCAT_LITERAL` alone, so a prefixed
# literal as a CHAIN OPERAND still was not, and the chain stopped in front of it:
#
#     secret = b"kit-" + b"SECRET"   ->  secret="<REDACTED>""SECRET"
#     password = "postgres://" + f"{user}:SECRET"
#     var apiKey = "sk-" + $"{env}-SECRET";
#
# The same shape one position over, missed in the commit that fixed the shape.
# Recorded plainly because it is the exact failure the repo's own "fix the class,
# not the instance" constraint names, committed while fixing that class -- a
# prefix is part of a literal wherever a literal is allowed, and there are two
# places this table says "a literal".
#
# ONE DEFINITION, REFERENCED. The first cut re-spelled the prefix here and
# claimed sharing it would mean moving three blocks; review on #190 doubted that
# and was right -- `_LITERAL_PREFIX` depends on nothing, so it moves above with
# no reordering at all, and the two constants that DO have an order
# (`_CONCAT_LITERAL` -> `_BARE_CHAR` -> `_CONCAT_CALL`) simply follow it. A
# duplicate pinned by a test is still a duplicate; the test only reports the
# drift after it has happened.

# ONE CHARACTER OF A BARE VALUE -- AND NOT AN OPERATOR THE CHAIN IS WAITING FOR.
# The chain above hangs off the END of the value, so it only ever sees what the

# `+` nor `.` nor `&`, so with no space around the operator it swallowed it and
# left the chain nothing to attach to. Found in review on #182, measured the
# same day, six shapes and every one a leak of a whole literal:

#     token=f()+"SECRET"            ->  token="<REDACTED>""SECRET"
#
# The SPACED forms of all five were already correct, because the class stops at
# a space and the chain took it from there -- which is exactly why the tests
# written for the chain missed this: every one of them had spaces.
#
# THE STOP IS CONDITIONAL ON A COMPLETE LITERAL FOLLOWING, not on the operator
# alone. `+` and `.` are ordinary base64, so refusing them unconditionally would
# truncate a bare secret one character early and leak the rest to the model:
# `x('token=AbC+')` must still go whole. Requiring the chain's own literal
# pattern to match after the operator means the class only yields where the
# chain will actually pick up, and `AbC+` followed by an unterminated `'` is
# still one value.
#
# TWO ALTERNATIVES ON DISJOINT CHARACTER SETS, so the ordinary characters -- all
# but three of them -- take the first branch with no literal lookahead, and only
# a literal `+`, `.` or `&` pays for one. The key check in front of both (below)
# is the one lookahead every character pays. RedactionIsLinear pins the cost.
# THE SYMBOL OPERATORS, ONCE. The chain below matches these, and the bare class
# above has to stop in front of exactly these -- two spellings of one set, and
# when the set grew (`%`, `||`, `??`) only one of them grew. That is the fourth
# instance this week of an atom spelled twice and fixed once, so it is a shared
# constant rather than a matching pair. The word forms (`or`, `and`) are not
# here: they need whitespace on both sides, which a character-wise class cannot
# express, and a bare value cannot contain one without the space that ends it.
# `+` IS IN HERE FOR THE BOUNDARY, NOT FOR THE CHAIN. The chain spells its
# `+` branch separately because `+` alone reaches a BARE operand and the
# others do not, so the two cannot share one alternative. `+` still belongs in
# this set because `_BARE_CHAR` has to stop in front of every operator the
# chain can follow, `+` included. The chain's shared-constant branch does
# re-match `+`, harmlessly -- the `+` alternative is first and wins. Said out
# loud because it reads like the "spelled twice" defect this constant was
# introduced to end, and it is the one place that is deliberate. Raised in
# review on #192.
_CHAIN_OP = r"(?:\.{1,2}|\|\||\?\?|[+&%])"

# `[ \t]*` INSIDE THE LOOKAHEAD, because the chain allows it and this has to
# agree with the chain or the two disagree about where a value ends. It demanded
# the literal be GLUED to the operator, so `token = pre+ "SECRET"` -- operator
# glued left, space right -- failed the lookahead, the `+` was eaten as part of
# the bare token, and the chain had no operator left to attach to. Five
# operators, five leaks, raised in review on #192.
#
# The generator could not find it: `OPERAND_SPACING` varied the two sides
# TOGETHER (`{opspace}{op}{opspace}`), so every case it produced was symmetric.
# That is the same defect as a hand-written pin inheriting the shape that
# motivated it, one level up -- an axis that cannot express the asymmetry cannot
# find it. The axes vary independently now.
#
# A KEY GLUED INTO A BARE VALUE ENDS IT. The bare value read through a key and
# its separator like any other text, so one match swallowed the next key and
# the scan resumed past that key's value:
#
#     token = abc]password: hunter2  ->  token="<REDACTED>" hunter2
#     token = 4]password: hunter2    ->  token="<REDACTED>" hunter2
#
# Every key the table knows (`_SECRET_NAME`, then `_SEPARATOR` across the gap
# the table allows) now ends the bare value in front of it, so the scan
# restarts at that key and redacts its value. This is what lets an exemption
# decline a value safely: on review of #327, declining
# `password: ${PW:?m}]password: hunter2` sent `hunter2` to the model through
# exactly this path. The check is a lookahead every character pays, and it

class _LineQuoteParity:
    """Is a double quote already OPEN on this line, at this offset?

    The bare-value branch of `_redact_assignment` asks this to pick a placeholder
    quote that does not close the string the value is sitting inside. The obvious
    way to answer it is a back-scan to the start of the line, per match:

        line_start = m.string.rfind("\\n", 0, m.start()) + 1
        m.string[line_start:m.start()].count('"') % 2

    That is correct and it is QUADRATIC: one long line with many keys rescans the
    whole line for every one of them. It is not a theoretical cost. Measured on
    the shapes `RedactionIsLinear` already pins, `"password: " * 200_000` took
    119 seconds against that test's 10-second ceiling, which is why the fix was
    reverted the first time and the broken output pinned as a wart instead
    (#177).

    `re.sub` hands its matches over left to right and non-overlapping, so the
    answer can be CARRIED FORWARD rather than recomputed: each call counts only
    the gap since the previous one. The gaps are disjoint, so one pass reads the
    subject once no matter how many matches it holds. Same answer, linear time.

    THE GAP IS TAKEN FROM THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT, not from the redacted output, and
    it spans the previous match's own text -- `m.string` is what `re.sub` is
    scanning, and quotes the previous match consumed are quotes the author wrote
    on that line. This is the same span the back-scan above counted, which is
    what makes the two agree rather than merely look similar.

    Counting the SUBJECT rather than the OUTPUT is exact wherever a replacement
    balances what it replaced, which is everywhere but one shape: an earlier
    value on the same line holding an ODD number of quotes -- an unterminated
    literal, or an escaped `\\"` inside a quoted one -- where the output's pair
    is even and the input's was not. Accepted, and named rather than left to be
    found: it needs a malformed value AND a second key on the same line, and
    what it degrades to is the flat `"` this whole change improves on.

    Two rules follow from being stateful. It RESETS ITSELF whenever the subject
    changes or a match arrives behind the cursor, so correctness never depends on
    a caller remembering to reset -- `redact()` runs once per file in the
    snapshot path, and the fallback tests drive `redact_assignment` through their
    own `re.sub`. And it assumes ONE THREAD, which this script is: `python
    claude_review.py`, one process per PR.

#
# So a value is hidden only when it is one of these:
#
# (0) any bare value in a CONFIG FILE: dotenv, YAML (compose and workflows
#     included), INI, cfg, conf or properties (`_CONFIG_FILE`). There a bare
#     value is the data itself, not code: `DB_PASSWORD=hunter2` in a .env file
#     is the password. Read from `_CONFIG_FILE_CURSOR`, which finds the file
#     header above the match. Text with no header (one line, in a test) is
#     read as code.
# (1) a quoted literal, with or without a string prefix (`qv`), or a literal
#     across a concatenation seam (`seam`). Always, whatever it holds.
# (2) a bare value that opens with a quote: the unterminated-literal fallback.
# (3) a bare value inside a double-quoted string on its line, such as the
#     password in `"Server=db;Password=hunter2;"`. That is literal text, not
#     code. Read from `_LINE_QUOTE_PARITY`, so only `"` counts: an apostrophe
#     in prose would make `'` unreliable.
# (4) a value whose chain carries a non-empty quoted literal, so
#     `opts.token || "hunter2"` and `prefix + "SECRET"` still go whole. An
#     empty literal holds nothing, so `x.get("k") or ""` is code.
# (5) a value that holds a high-entropy token anywhere, call arguments
#     included (`_is_token`), so `DB_PASSWORD=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG` and
#     `SecretStr("aB3dE5fG7hJ9kL1mN")` still go.
#
# Everything else goes back as written, and the declined value is SCANNED
# AGAIN for a key of its own (`_declined`). The match consumed it, so without
# the rescan `token = login(password="hunter2")` would hand the inner literal
# to the model.

    The old replacement was the literal `\\g<key>=<REDACTED>`, which flattened
    every separator the pattern accepts -- `:`, `=`, `:=`, `=>` -- down to `=`,
    and dropped the quotes. So a perfectly ordinary object literal

        const poisoned = { baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:9", apiKey: "abc\\ndef" };

    reached the reviewer as `apiKey=<REDACTED>`, which is not valid in an object
    literal, and the model reported a SyntaxError as a BLOCKING finding on a file
    that parses and whose suite is green in the same CI run. Three rounds on kit
    #169, and it is the third time this class has cost a whole review: the env
    lookup exemption and the regex literal exemption above were both added for
    the same failure with different inputs.

    Those two are EXEMPTIONS -- they decide not to redact something. This is not.
    The value is still gone. What changes is that the hole left behind is shaped
    like the language it sits in:

        apiKey: "abc\\ndef"     ->  apiKey: "<REDACTED>"      (parses)
        f("KEY=" + "abc123")   ->  f("KEY=<REDACTED>")      (parses)
        TOKEN = "abc123"       ->  TOKEN = "<REDACTED>"      (parses)
        token => "abc123"      ->  token => "<REDACTED>"     (parses)
        API_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG  ->  API_KEY="<REDACTED>"

    A bare value with no literal and no token in it is code, not a secret, and
    goes back as written: `token = request_context.set(ctx)` is unchanged.
    The block above `_is_token` says which values are hidden and why.

    THE PLACEHOLDER IS ALWAYS QUOTED, and in the SOURCE'S OWN QUOTE CHARACTER.
    Both halves were raised on review of #177 and both are corrections to the
    first cut of this function.

    Always, because `<REDACTED>` is not a valid token in any language where `<`
    and `>` are operators. Quoting only the values that ARRIVED quoted made
    exactly the shapes that already had quotes parse, and left `f(token=abc123)`
    coming out as `f(token=<REDACTED>)` -- the same broken-syntax report, one
    shape over, in a function written to stop them. A bare .env line gains a pair
    of quotes it did not have; .env, YAML and every shell accept them, and the
    redacted text is read, never executed.

    In the source's quote, because `'` and `"` are not interchangeable
    everywhere: in SQL a double-quoted token is an IDENTIFIER and a single-quoted
    one is a string, so rewriting `password = \'x\'` as `password="<REDACTED>"`
    changes what the line means rather than how it looks. `qv` holds the whole
    literal, so its first character is the quote the author chose.

    WHITESPACE AROUND THE SEPARATOR IS STILL DROPPED, deliberately and as before:
    `TOKEN = "x"` becomes `TOKEN="<REDACTED>"`, not `TOKEN = "<REDACTED>"`. The
    match consumes that whitespace and this is a redactor, not a formatter -- the
    contract is that the result PARSES and hides the value, never that it is
    pretty. Said out loud because it is the kind of lossy detail a reviewer
    reasonably flags as a bug. Raised on review of #177.
    """
    # A required-variable expansion goes back exactly as written. The match
    # consumed it, so the key inside its braces is never matched again

    #
    # A BARE VALUE HAS NO QUOTE TO PRESERVE, so it takes the one that does not
    # close the string it is sitting inside. `f("token=abc123")` came out as
    # `f("token="<REDACTED>"")`, which closes the enclosing literal and reopens
    # it. THE DAMAGE IS NARROWER THAN IT LOOKS AND WAS MEASURED, because the
    # obvious claim -- "that is a syntax error" -- is mostly false and would have
    # been the wrong reason to change this: in JS and in Python alike the line
    # re-balances into a comparison chain (`"token=" < REDACTED > ""`) and
    # PARSES, which is exactly how it survived #177. What it stops being is a
    # STRING. The author's literal is now a comparison against an undeclared
    # name, and where `<` is not an operator -- JSON, YAML, .env, the formats a
    # diff is full of -- it does not parse at all: `{"note": "token=abc123"}`
    # redacted to invalid JSON, and no longer does. With a `"` already open on
    # the line the placeholder is single-quoted instead, and
    # `f("token='<REDACTED>'")` is still one string holding one hidden value.
    #
    # This was the known wart of #177 and it was NOT a wart of taste. The first
    # fix asked the question with a back-scan per match and took 119 seconds
    # against the 10-second ceiling in
    # RedactionIsLinear.test_a_pathological_input_redacts_in_linear_time, so it
    # was reverted. `_LineQuoteParity` is the same answer carried forward across
    # matches instead of rescanned per match; the cost is one extra pass over
    # the subject, and the whole shape is pinned by
    # test_a_quote_that_closes_an_enclosing_string_is_not_eaten.
    #
    # Nothing is open on the line of an ordinary `TOKEN=abc123`, which still gets
    # the double quote it always had.
    #
    # ASKED AT THE OFFSET THE PLACEHOLDER LANDS ON, which is past the key's own
    # closing quote, not at the start of the key. `"brokerApiKey": resolveKey(x)`
    # has a `"` open in front of `ApiKey` -- the JSON key's -- but group `q`
    # closes it and the replacement puts it back, so the value is NOT inside a
    # string and single-quoting it would emit `"brokerApiKey":'<REDACTED>'`,
    # which is not JSON. Nothing between `q` and the value can hold a quote (the
    # key, the separator, the type word and whitespace), so this offset is exact.
    # The one shape it reads on the wrong line is the YAML value that sits on the
    # line BELOW its key, which has no quote of its own to be endangered by.
    #
    # THE SAME ANSWER DECIDES WHETHER A BARE VALUE IS HIDDEN AT ALL: a `"` open
    # at the value means the value is text inside a literal (rule (3) above
    # `_is_token`). So does the file the value sits in: in a config file every

# against the `SK` entry alone; measured across the table it was 20 of 20, so
# the boundary went on once, at the build site, rather than twenty times.
#
# The two key entries written out in this table, `sk-` and `AKIA`, sat above
# that build site and never got it. So a capaz category code for help desk and
# end-user support reached the model as `help-desk-<REDACTED>`: the `sk-`
# inside `desk-`, plus the twenty characters after it, is an OpenAI key by
# shape. The CI reviewer on capaz#16 then reported its own redaction as
# blocking data corruption in a pack file that was correct. The boundary is
# defined here, above the table, so every key-shape entry takes it, and
# `test_every_key_shape_entry_carries_the_boundary` enumerates the table to
# keep it that way.
#
# The class is word characters only. `-` is deliberately out: after a hyphen a
# prefix genuinely begins a new token, and matching there keeps the bias toward
# over-redaction on the one case where the two directions disagree.
#
# AN ESCAPE OR A PERCENT-ENCODED BYTE ENDS A WORD TOO. `\n`, `\r` and `\t` in a

# `"\tAKIA..."` and `a%3Dsk-...` reached the model whole, each one redacted
# before these two entries took the boundary. So the boundary also opens right
# after `\n`, `\r`, `\t` or `%XX`, which reaches every vendor entry as well.
# `desk-` is still one word. A key glued to any other word character
# (`key_sk-...`, a `\x41` escape) is the blind spot HARNESS.md names.

    # `password == other` is a comparison, and matching its first `=` redacted
    # the second and left the line unable to parse. `'password' => 'hunter2'` used to slip through
    # the same gap as the JSON key below. A match arm, `token => x` or
    # `token => f(x)`, is redacted, an accepted over-redaction. Nor is a `:?`
    # that opens an expansion closing on the same line: it is the
    # required-variable operator of `${PASSWORD:?msg}`, and reading it as a
    # separator redacted the message inside a connection URL
    # (`_PARAM_EXPANSION` says why). With no `}` after it, `:?` is a separator
    # like any other, so `password:?hunter2` redacts.
    #
    # A `${{ secrets.X }}` expression names a secret without containing one.
    # Redacting it rewrote `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`
    # into `API_KEY=<REDACTED> secrets... }}` before the model saw the diff, and
    # the model then reported the workflow as broken YAML, as a blocking
    # finding, on a line that was fine. The lookahead leaves expressions alone,
    # quoted or bare, and with the stray space of `" ${{ secrets.X }}"`: that
    # is still an expression, and the space is a workflow bug the model can
    # only flag if it gets to see it.
    #
    # A CONCATENATION SEAM sits between the separator and the value. Inside an
    # enclosing string the operator hides between two quotes belonging to
    # DIFFERENT literals -- `f("API_KEY=" + "hunter2")` -- so the value branch
    # read `" + "` as a complete string, redacted that, and left the secret in
    # plain text after it. The bridge consumes `" + ` when ANY quote follows --
    # not only the same one, because `f("API_KEY=" + 'hunter2')` switches
    # character across the seam and leaked when it had to match. The chain below
    # cannot reach this shape at all: the operator it needs is already inside a
    # literal. `_redact_assignment` drops the opening quote when the bridge
    # fired, since the one it ate was the enclosing literal's closing quote, and
    # closes with the bridge's quote rather than the value's.
    #
    # A quoted value is a value too, and it runs to its closing quote, spaces
    # included: `password: "abc123"` never matched when the class excluded the
    # opening quote, and `password: "correct horse battery"` lost only its first
    # word. An escaped quote inside the value does not close it: `"hun\"ter2"`
    # matched up to the backslash and leaked `ter2"}` to the model, the one
    # leak the downstream reviews of the JSON-key fix found. `\\.` takes any
    # backslash escape, `""` / `''` the doubled quote of YAML single quotes,
    # SQL and PowerShell. An unterminated quote falls back to the bare-token
    # form.
    #
    # A JSON key carries its closing quote between the name and the colon, so
    # `"password": "hunter2"` never matched: `\s*[:=]` had to follow the name
    # directly, and the whole value went to the model as written (verified with
    # a probe on 2026-08-22). A quote after the name (group `q`) admits the JSON
    # and Python-dict forms, and that form stays on one line, separator and
    # value alike, which the conditionals on `q` enforce: no serializer breaks
    # the line between a key and its colon, a JSON value always follows on the
    # key's line, and a quoted name that does end a line is code: `if kind ==
    # "token":` above a line of code, or a formatted ternary with `? "token"`
    # above `: "cookie"`.
    #
    # The unquoted form spans ONE line break, since YAML allows `password:`
    # with its scalar on the next line. It reads through the `+`, `-` or space
    # that prefixes every line of a diff, which is what this function mostly
    # sees, and which the old `\s*` took as the value, leaving the real one on
    # the wire. It stops at a blank line (`password:` in prose, then a code
    # fence) and at a sibling key (`password:` left empty, `username:` below
    # it), both of which used to be folded into one mangled line. The one
    # shape it leaves on purpose is a next-line value that is itself `word:`
    # at the end of its line, which cannot be told from a key; on the key's
    # own line a value ending in `:` is a value and is redacted.
    #
    # The spaces between the separator and the value have ONE reading. The run
    # after the line break sits inside the optional group, so a run on the
    # key's own line belongs to the first `[ \t]*` alone. With that run after
    # the group instead, the two could share K spaces in about K*K/2 ways, and
    # a value the rule then declined (an exempt number, or no value at all)

    # `ident[...]`, `$(...)`, a bare `(...)` and any run of those suffixes are
    # consumed, three paren levels deep (a call in a call in the value's own
    # call), and either go back as written or are hidden whole: nothing
    # dangles either way. A call that breaks across lines, or nests a fourth
    # level, falls back to the bare form and is decided on its first fragment.
    # The token ends before `,`, `;` and `)`, which no secret contains and
    # which the code around a value does: `login(password=pw, user=u)` used to
    # lose its comma and `connect(host=h, password=pw)` its closing paren. A
    # trailing quote is the value's own only when a leading one opened it (the
    # unterminated-quote fallback); otherwise it closes the ENCLOSING literal
    # and stays, so `x('api_key=abc123')` keeps its closing quote instead of
    # reading as an unterminated string in the reviewed diff. A lone `-` or
    # `+` before a space is a list marker or a diff marker, not a value, so
    # `password:` above `- item` stays as written.
    #
    # A bare value that is a type word is an annotation, not a secret: every
    # typed Python signature (`def login(user: str, password: str)`) and TS
    # parameter (`(_token: string) => {}`) matched here, and the model then
    # reported the file as syntactically broken. A closed set of type words
    # (_TYPE), optionally `| None`, with no `=` after it, is left as written,
    # and so is an absent value (`password = None`, `token = null`). A typed
    # DEFAULT is decided like any other value, and the annotation in front of
    # it always goes back: `password: str = "hunter2"` comes out as
    # `password: str = "<REDACTED>"`, and `secret: bytes = field(repr=False)`
    # comes out as written.
    #
    # A REQUIRED-VARIABLE EXPANSION, `${NAME:?msg}` or `${NAME?msg}`, is group
    # `ref` and comes back exactly as written; `_PARAM_EXPANSION` says which
    # forms qualify and why. Any other `${...}` is consumed through its closing
    # brace, so nothing after a space inside it dangles, and is then decided
    # like any other bare value.
    #
    # Group `val` is the whole value with its chain, and `chain` the chain
    # alone. `_redact_assignment` reads both: `val` is the span it hides or
    # rescans, and `chain` is where a concatenated literal shows up.
    #
    # A BARE NUMBER under the `token` name (group `tok`) is a count and stays as
    # written, annotation included; `_NUMBER` says which shapes qualify and why.
    # `tok` is set by a lookbehind on the key rather than by an alternative of
    # its own, and the lookbehind has a negative twin, so a `token` key has ONE
    # way through the group. An optional group, or `(?P<tok>token)` ahead of a
    # list that also holds `token`, would let a declined number backtrack to
    # the path without `tok`, skip the number test and redact the count.
    #
    # re.VERBOSE, so the branches can sit one per line: whitespace outside a
    # character class is layout, not pattern. Named groups, so the conditionals
    # and the replacement read as what they test rather than as a number.

# THE OTHER HALF OF THE TABLE, AND THE ONE THAT SCALES.
#
# Everything above this line PARSES SYNTAX to find a value position, and every
# leak found in the week of 2026-08-31 was there: spacing, prefixes, operands,
# backticks, escaped quotes, fallback operators, subscript assignment,
# positional arguments. That half is unbounded -- each language, quoting form
# and operator is another branch -- and eight classes of it are still open,
# recorded in HARNESS.md and #188.
#
# The three entries above ask a different question: not "where is the value"
# but "is this string a key". That question needs no syntax at all, so no
# quoting form can hide from it. There were three of them; there should be
# these.
#
# A PREFIX, NOT AN ENTROPY THRESHOLD, and the difference was measured rather
# than assumed. Against the shapes the parser misses, carrying real credential
# formats:
#
#     tuned entropy rule   14% caught,  0.079% of repo lines redacted
#     loose entropy rule   57% caught,  9.9%   of repo lines redacted
#     vendor prefixes      75% caught,  0.008% of repo lines redacted
#
# The prefix rule beats both entropy variants on BOTH axes -- five times the
# recall of the affordable one, at a tenth of its cost. The reason is
# structural: a prefix is a literal string, so nothing that is not a GitHub
# token begins `ghp_`, while entropy is a proxy that collides with git SHAs,
# UUIDs, content hashes, base64 assets and minified code. An earlier draft of
# this comment recommended entropy on the strength of a 34-of-34 result; that
# measurement used a sentinel chosen to look exactly like what the rule
# detected, and against real key formats the same rule scored 6 of 16.
#
# WHAT IT STILL CANNOT SEE, and why that is not an argument against it: an AWS
# SECRET access key (no prefix, by design), a raw hex or UUID key, and any
# passphrase. Those are the 25%, and no regex reaches them -- TruffleHog does,
# because it VERIFIES candidates against the vendor rather than matching them,
# which is a thing a redactor cannot do. This is a heuristic in front of a
# model; that is the boundary.
#
# The replacement keeps the prefix, as the three entries above do, because
# "you leaked a GitHub token" is worth more to a reviewer than "you leaked
# something".

        # no comment at all, and the reason lived in a stack trace in the job
        # log. Measured on kit #192 on 2026-08-31: `TimeoutError: The read
        # operation timed out` after 5m17s, no comment, no status file.
        #
        # THE COMMENT ABOVE THIS ONE ALREADY DESCRIBES THIS FAILURE HAPPENING
        # ONCE BEFORE, and the fix chosen then was to raise the timeout from 60s
        # to 300s. That treated the symptom -- the review got slower, so the
        # ceiling moved -- and left the class: any network exception still took
        # the status file with it. It fired again at 300s. A timeout is not a
        # thing a ceiling can be raised past, only made rarer.
        #
        # OSError is the right net rather than a list of names: TimeoutError,
        # socket.timeout, ConnectionResetError and urllib's URLError are all
        # subclasses of it, and a new one will be too. HTTPError is a subclass
        # of URLError and therefore of OSError, so the handler above MUST stay
